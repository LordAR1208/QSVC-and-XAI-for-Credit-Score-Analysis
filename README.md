# QSVC-and-XAI-for-Credit-Score-Analysis

Researched on the topic of ’Credit Scoring Analysis’ using quantum machine learning and Explainable AI.
Developed and tested QSVC algorithm using Qiskit reaching an accuracy rate of 84%.
Applied LIME for model transparency of the QSVC results against 78% accuracy of classical SVC.
